# Skin-Cancer-Detetction-using-Deep-Learning
So basically this is a skin cancer detection model trained with InceptionV3 and we have also made a web application for users to test if they have Skin Cancer or not.
So download the data set and keep the train and test folders under the same directory of all the other files
The Dataset is provided by Kaggle ( https://www.kaggal.com/datasets/fancomic/skin-cancer-malignantvs-benign/download?datasetVersionNumber=4)
