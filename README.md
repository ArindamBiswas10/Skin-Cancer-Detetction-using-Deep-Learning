# Skin-Cancer-Detetction-using-Deep-Learning
So basically this is a skin cancer detection model trained with InceptionV3 and we have also made a web application for users to test if they have Skin Cancer or not.
So download the data set and keep the train and test folders under the same directory of all the other files
The Dataset is provided by Kaggle ( https://www.kaggal.com/datasets/fancomic/skin-cancer-malignantvs-benign/download?datasetVersionNumber=4)
and then set the path for the test and train directory in test.py file
install the necessary python libraries 'Tensorflow' ,'matplotlib', 'keras'. Tip: If you are unable to install it use cmd on admin mode and then try again.
Run the test.py file and the model will train and give the accuray and loss data. It will also plot the graph.
After that set the path of the model in the webapplication.py and run the web app
That's all for now 
further changes will be made in future and people contributing will be appreciated.
